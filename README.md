This specialised tool is designed to help you self-update your Laravel deployment directly from GitHub.

_This project assumes your package includes all built front-end JavaScript assets._

Using artisan, you can update the package via the CLI or a tool such as Laravel Envoy.

## Installation

During beta, you can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require pixelated-au/streamline:dev-main
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="streamline-config"
```

You will need to set the following environment variables in your `.env` file.
- Replace [github] and [project-name] with your GitHub repository.
- Version installed is the version of the package that is currently installed. It will be set automatically.

```dotenv
STREAMLINE_GITHUB_RELEASE_REPOSITORY=[github]/[project-name]
STREAMLINE_APPLICATION_VERSION_INSTALLED=v0.0.0
```

## Events

This library emits two events for hooking into updates:

- `\Pixelated\Streamline\Events\AvailableVersionsUpdated` Emits when it's pulled down the available versions from GitHub
- `\Pixelated\Streamline\Events\InstalledVersionSet` Emits when the current, installed version has been set
- `\Pixelated\Streamline\Events\NextAvailableVersionUpdated` Emits when the next available version has been set

# Artisan Console

There are several Artisan commands that you can interact with:

- `streamline:check` Check for an available update
- `streamline:clean-assets` Tidy up the front-end build assets directory. Default values are configured in
  config/streamline.php. This can be set using a schedule
- `streamline:list` Retrieves the available updates from GitHub and stores them in the cache
- `streamline:run-update` CLI update of the software. Make sure to back up first!

## Questions

What is the point of this project?
: Unlike other updater projects available (which are excellent by the way), this runs an update by calling an external
PHP script/class. For performance reasons, Laravel loads classes dynamically. If updating directly within Laravel, the
application may fail to load classes that have been removed/deprecated causing the update to fail, leaving a broken
site. This project runs an update by calling an external PHP script/class, ensuring that during the update, there is an
extremely low chance of the update failing.

Why is does this project assume all front-end assets will be pre-compiled?
: To bypass any potential compilation needs. Building a release of a project using something like CI or doing it locally
ensures that when it's deployed, there are no post-processing requirements. For example, you don't need to have NPM or
Node installed. You don't need to worry about the version of Node that's installed either. It simplifies updates

Does this need Composer installed? OR How do I run Composer to install dependencies?
: Yes, Composer is required to install dependencies. It happens automatically as part of the update.

Who is this for?
: It was built so that a project could be deployed on single-instance machines, not unlike upgrading a WordPress
instance. It's designed to simplify deployment - moving the build/dependency mechanics into a centralised place such as
CI. For example, this could be used inside a cPanel hosting environment.

Who's it not for?
: If you have a project being deployed onto virtual machines inside dedicated environments, other 'updater' projects
may suit your needs more than this project. That said, this project was designed with extensibility in mind. As such, if
you're keen to extend it, you can either do a pull request or extend it locally in your project.

Extending/Customising
: Streamline is built upon a pipeline architecture, so you can inject your own steps into the update process. For
example, if you wish to make it build your front-end assets instead of using pre-built assets, you can create a new 
pipeline step.

: Use the config file `config/streamline.php` to customise the update process to suit your needs.

: You can also create your own implementation of `Pixelated\Streamline\Interfaces\UpdateBuilderInterface` which is the
tool to progressively gather information about the update process before the final update is run.
